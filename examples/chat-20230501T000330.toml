content = """To check if a file is a directory in Deno, you can use the `Deno.stat()` function which returns a `Deno.FileInfo` object containing metadata about the file. You can then check the `isDirectory` property of the `Deno.FileInfo` object to determine if the file is a directory or not.

Here's an example code snippet that checks if a file is a directory:

```typescript
const fileInfo = await Deno.stat("/path/to/file/or/directory");

if (fileInfo.isDirectory) {
  console.log("File is a directory");
} else {
  console.log("File is not a directory");
}
```

In this example snippet, replace `"/path/to/file/or/directory"` with the path to the file or directory that you want to check. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the asynchronous `Deno.stat()` function to return the `Deno.FileInfo` object. The `isDirectory` property of the `Deno.FileInfo` object is then checked to determine if the file is a directory."""
